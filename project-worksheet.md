## Project Description

This is a site where you can look up information about the bugs and fish in the game Animal Crossings.

## API

ACNH is the REST API I'm using. It was actually my second choice, but the API I wanted to use has closed off API key requests. ACHN doesn't require authentification keys. Below is an example of the data this API returns.

Here's a link to the documentation: https://acnhapi.com/doc 


```
{
"id": 1,
"file-name": "bitterling",
"name": {},
"availability": {},
"shadow": "Smallest (1)",
"price": 900,
"price-cj": 1350,
"catch-phrase": "I caught a bitterling! It's mad at me, but only a little.",
"museum-phrase": "Bitterlings hide their eggs inside large bivalves—like clams—where the young can stay safe until grown. The bitterling isn't being sneaky. No, their young help keep the bivalve healthy by eating invading parasites! It's a wonderful bit of evolutionary deal making, don't you think? Each one keeping the other safe... Though eating parasites does not sound like a happy childhood... Is that why the fish is so bitter?",

### MVP/PostMVP & Time Tracker

[Please see this Google Sheets for my time/priority matrix.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSBAB-1Z6zPF7iHdsZdZYaANFCbnBckTij17FF0pg7X0UCbtP7Msj3922x-wb3p5D8bFvoOpCI-CWO4/pubhtml)

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Show all Critters | This will display all of the critters in a grid format| 
| Single Critter | Display one critter's information | 
| Search | Type in a critter's name and pull up a single critter | 
| 404  | Critter not found page | 
| Months filter | Click a month to see which critter's are active | 



## Additional Libraries
 ReactStrap
